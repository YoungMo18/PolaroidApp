**Digital Diary:**



* Allows users to keep track of their thoughts through their phone screen. Imitates an actual diary, but is implemented through an app. Also includes a bookmarking feature for users to save their “page”.

**Recipe App:**



* Allows users to look up different recipes ranging from easy to hard difficulty. Alongside that, the app also filters different types of recipes from breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also allows users to post and save their own recipes.

**Polaroid App:**



* Allows users to take polaroid styled photos through their iPhone’s camera lens. Users can save, favorite, and delete their photos. Eventually in the future, users will be able to print those pictures.
